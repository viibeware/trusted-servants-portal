    Side effect: mutates each visited heading block in-place to add an
    `_anchor` key on its `data` dict so the renderer can stamp the
    matching `id="…"` on its `<hN>` without redoing the slug + dup-
    counting logic. Anchors are stable for a given page-render but
    re-derived each request, so heading text edits flow through
    immediately.

    Only includes blocks of type 'heading' — section titles are not
    listed here because we no longer auto-render them as headings, and
    the admin can drop a Heading block at the top of a section if they
    want it in the TOC."""
